# ðŸŒŸ LangChain Chains Practice

This repository contains my practice codes while learning **LangChain** ðŸ¦œðŸ”—.  
I explored different chain types like:

- **LLMChain**  
- **SimpleSequentialChain**  
- **SequentialChain**  
- **RouterChain**  

These examples are from the **DeepLearning.AI LangChain course** that I recently completed.  
Itâ€™s part of my journey in building AI/ML + agentic applications. ðŸš€
